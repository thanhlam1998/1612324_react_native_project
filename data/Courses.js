    transcript: "Hey there. This is Jim Cooper. ‑And this is Joe Eames. ‑Welcome to our Pluralsight course, Angular 2 Fundamentals. Joe and I have been developers for a long time, and we've been building large‑scale Angular applications ever since Angular 1's official release. And we're excited to share with you what we've learned about Angular 2. This course will give you all the fundamental knowledge you need in order to start building your own Angular applications, whether for small, fun personal projects or for large enterprise applications. In this course, you'll gain a high‑level understanding of the architecture of Angular applications in addition to a detailed understanding of building applications with Angular. Once we introduce you to the high‑level concepts, we'll spend most of this course actually writing code for a demo application that models real‑world applications. This intermediate‑level course has been designed to help you learn Angular from the ground up. If you feel like things are moving a little too quickly, you can check out one of the beginner‑level courses, but we've tried to make this a course that will teach you the fundamentals, even if you've had no prior experience with Angular. In this course, you'll learn about the following: the architecture of an Angular application and how to bootstrap a new application, Angular components and template syntax, including pipes and directives, creating reusable services and how dependency injection works in Angular, working with forms and validation, making API calls with HTTP and observables, and how to unit test and end‑to‑end test your application, and finally, how to package it all together for production. When you have finished this course, you will know enough about Angular to start building real‑world applications using Angular best practices. The only real prerequisite for this course is that you have some knowledge of JavaScript and HTML, but you certainly don't need to be an expert. So join us as we explore the exciting world of Angular.",

    transcript: "Hi. This is Scott Allen, and welcome to C# Fundamentals. The goal of this course is to give you all the knowledge that you need to start being productive with the C# programming language. C# has consistently been one of the top three programming languages to learn because it's used widely in the industry and it's an expressive and powerful language. In this course, we're going to learn about the C# language, as well as the .NET Framework that you'll use when building software with C#. We are going to build a gradebook application to store grades from a class of students, and along the way we'll learn how to define classes and methods in C#, as well as learn essential topics like error handling. We'll also discuss object‑oriented programming with C#, and I'll give you a list of my best practices for the language before we leave the course. By the end of the course, you'll be ready to contribute to your own projects with C#, and you'll also be prepared to move on to some additional C# courses, covering features in more detail, like generics in C# and Language Integrated Query, or LINQ, with C#. Now, I do assume you already have a small amount of basic programming knowledge before you start this course, so hopefully you've already done some work with true and false and Boolean logic, and you've seen how to write a loop in some other language. If so, we're ready to start.",

    transcript: "Hey everyone. This is Mike Pfeiffer, and welcome to Architecting for Reliability on AWS. In this course, we'll work together to implement a highly available and reliable application architecture using the patterns and best practices recommended by AWS. To get started, we'll take a look at key concepts and course services when it comes to working on AWS, and you'll learn how to set up foundational services like identity and access management, how to enable and review audit logs, and how to set up alarms and notifications. Next, we'll move onto learning some of the common architectural patterns used every day by real-world AWS solution architects to build reliable systems and to implement fault tolerance into an application architecture running on AWS. Throughout the rest of the course, we'll work step by step to build up an application architecture across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region, and you'll learn how to properly design and deploy a virtual private cloud environment consisting of redundant database instances along with autoscaling groups that power a load-balanced web application. We'll also discuss how to further increase the reliability of an application architecture on AWS by implementing multi-region solutions for disaster recovery in global scale. So whether you're looking to pick up AWS architecture skills for the real world, or you're just preparing for AWS's certification, you're definitely in the right place, and I look forward to working with you as we explore how to architect reliable applications on the AWS cloud platform.",

Among the things we do is to create big data and machine learning, training courses and labs like this course, big data and machine learning. Fundamental Should Google Cloud Platform. This course was designed to showcase really World data and ML challenges and give you practical hands on expertise in solving those challenges using Google Cloud. It's a critical course to master because it covers the most common use cases you and your team will encounter on your big data journey. This course is divided into six content modules in the first model, which is a data driven decision making. You will learn all about the data and ML tools available on G C P from a high level organizational perspective. And then in the next four models, you will be introduced to Google Cloud products in context as they're employed to solve riel world problems in the four models. In addition to expanding your knowledge about our products and platform, you will also get to practice with hands on quick labs. Finally, in the summary model will do a recap off. Everything you've learned in this course and provide you with additional resource is on the topics that you've done in each model. This is the typical order will follow. First, we'll have lectures from subject matter experts, where will introduce a big data scenario and the associated challenges and how to address them with cloud technologies. Next, you'll see a ____ off the solution and action, which will highlight key features that you will learn and practice in your labs. After you understand the scenarios and have watched the demos, it's time for you to practice with quick clubs in a riel Google cloud plaque from account. Finally, you will explore riel customer use cases and architectures so you can familiarize yourself with best practices and get inspired in your own solutions. In other words, we describe a common class of big data and ML problems and horn in on one specific problem, and then we show you a ____ off a solution to that problem. And then we talk about why we built a solution that way, using that opportunity to cover how and when to use the various products used in the solution. Finally, we widen the lens and show you really world applications that are variants off the principles covered in the chapter. You're already taking this course, which means you recognize the importance off big data processing. But why is this skill set in such high demand? According to McKinsey research, by 2020 we'll have 50,000,000,000 devices connected in the Internet of things. These devices will cost a supply of data to double every two years. Unfortunately, though, only about 1% of the data generated today is actually analyzed. According to McKinsey, this state of affairs provides a wide open opportunity because there's a lot of value in data, I believe, at the ability to build applications that handle large amounts of data and derive insights from that data in an automated manner. This ability is a skill that will be well rewarded in the marketplace. Individuals who have the skill will have many opportunities open to them, and companies that developed the skill will become more successful. So the opportunity for data analysts, data scientists and data engineers will talk about what these rules are and what the differences are. The opportunity for all three off these roles is very clear. At its core, this course is primarily geared towards data engineers. That said, if you're an analyst and ml engineer, our attack lead for your team. It's a valuable skill to know how all the big data and animal products interact to solve some of the most common challenges that data engineers face. And what are those challenges? Those challenges are migrating your existing big data workloads to an environment where you can effectively analyze all of your data interactively analyzing large and by large I mean terabytes to patter bites. Analyzing large data sets off historical data ____ buildings, callable pipelines that can handle streaming data so that your business can make data driven decisions more quickly and finally building machine learning models so that you're not just reacting to data, you're able to make predictive, forward looking actions using your data",
